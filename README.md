# Mapped-Scriptures

This app is built on a split view controller. The main view allows the user to navigate from Volumes to Books to Chapters to Content. 
The detail view shows a map of geocoded places. 

The app does not navigate from the main view to the detail view. Either the main view is shown, or both views are shown on larger devices/orientations. 

I showed the app to a couple of my roommates and they thought it was really cool. Of course they would like to see the map be visible when on smaller iPhones,
but they did also have a couple ideas of how it could be improved:
1) Like the Gospel Library app, show the chapters in a collection view
2) Implement a search feature to search for a location and see the scriptures with that location
